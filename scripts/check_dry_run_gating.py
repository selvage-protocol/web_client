"""The guard around what a workflow's `dry_run` input promises.

`.github/workflows/release.yml` and `.github/workflows/deploy-prod.yml` both declare a `dry_run`
input. Each has a plan step conditioned positively on it — the release's prints the version its
bump would cut and what the steps below it would do, the deploy's prints the one-line request it
would hand `deployci` on the box — and every step after each of them carries `!inputs.dry_run`.
The flag is worth exactly as much as that: the plan step is a `run:` block printing a promise, and
what keeps the promise is the conditions on the steps below it. A step added later with no
condition does what the plan said it would not — cuts a release, or points the public demo at
another image — which is what happened in `reference_server`, whose `release.yml` printed "nothing
was resolved, written, committed, pushed or dispatched" and then cut a release. This is that
repository's checker (`reference_server/scripts/check_dry_run_gating.py`), carried here because a
regression in either file is otherwise found by a dispatch rather than by CI.

`actionlint` cannot see it. Every step in a file like these is syntactically valid, every `if:` is
a well-formed expression and the file lints clean; the defect is *which steps do not carry one*.
So the rule here is positional, and it judges a step by where it stands rather than by its name:

  * a workflow that declares a `dry_run` input has a step conditioned **positively** on it —
    the rehearsal, which prints what a real run would do;
  * every step after that one, in its job or in a job below it, must carry a condition that
    excludes a dry run, or be in a job that does.

Both jobs here are one long ordered step list, so "after the plan" is the order the steps are
written in; a step appended at the end of either job is caught without anything naming it. A
mutating step added later is caught by its position, whatever it is called and whatever it runs,
which is the point of not keeping a list of commands here.

Run it directly, against this repository's workflows or a copy of them:

    python3 -B scripts/check_dry_run_gating.py [workflows-dir ...]

or as this repository's gate runs it: `ci.yml` installs Debian's `python3` and `python3-yaml` in
the `node:22-trixie-slim` container its job runs in — the one check here that is not Node's — and
`scripts/ci-local.sh checks` runs the same file through a venv under `.tmp/`, so this needs the
network once and nothing after that.

## What it cannot catch, and does not claim to

  * **A step before the plan step, or the plan step itself, that changes something outside the
    runner.** The prefix is what a dry run is meant to exercise — the credential refusal, the two
    tag reads, the request the deploy builds — and nothing structural tells a read from a write
    there. `test_the_prefix_is_not_read` in `scripts/test_check_dry_run_gating.py` pins that
    residual rather than leaving it implied.
  * **A spelling of the same test this does not know.** A condition that names `dry_run` in a form
    not in `EXCLUDED`/`RUN_ON_DRY_RUN` is reported rather than assumed safe, which covers the
    `||` forms and anything unrecognised, but an equivalent test written some third way is a false
    alarm rather than a pass.
  * **A mutation performed indirectly** — a reusable workflow, a composite action, or a `run:`
    body that shells out to a script which pushes. What a gated step runs is not read.
  * **Workflows without a `dry_run` input**, which is `ci.yml` and `image.yml` here: there is
    nothing to rehearse there, so there is nothing to check. A directory where *no* workflow
    declares the input is refused instead, so a scan that reaches nothing cannot report success.
